## Chris Isaak

> « Most of us are as terrified of love as little kids are 
> terrified of the world. Little kids come up to you and say, 
> "I know someone who loves you" or "I know someone who likes you".
> They say it like, I'm not going to really come out and say it. 
> And for adults, it's probably the same way. 
> They never really get beyond that fear. »
> <br/>-- Chris Isaak
